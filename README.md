# Twitter-Bot
I made a bot that uses Twitter API and it can automatically tweet, reply, search tweets based on location/Hashtags/keywords, post images etc.

Language used: NodeJS

Author: Shivam Parashar

How to start?
	run on command line : 		$ node bots.js
	


What does it do:

	1)It can get tweets, by running "GetTweet.js" and changing the status to desired data that you need.
	
	2)It can get reply, by running "TY4Following.js" and it will keep on tweeting thanks to @UserName.
	
	3)It can get post tweets, by running "bots.js" and changing the data to be posted, you can get desired output. Also it can post in a regular interval of time.
	
	4)It can get post images, it can post images but inorder to do that you must have processing-java in your computer device. and running the command can get you post the image, provided that the image sketch is made the given folder.
	
		cmd = './processing-java --sketch `pwd`/rainbow --run';
		exe(cmd,processing);
