# Twitter-Bot
I made a bot that uses Twitter API and it can automatically tweet, reply, search tweets based on location/Hashtags/keywords, post images etc.

Language used: NodeJS

Author: Shivam Parashar

How to start?
	run on command line : 		$ node bots.js
	


What does it do:

	1)It can get tweets, running "GetTweet.js" and changing the status to desired data that you need.
	
	2)It can get reply, running "TY4Following.js" and it will keep on tweeting thanks to @UserName.
	
	3)It can get post tweets, running "bots.js" and changing the data to be posted, you can get desired output. Also it can post in a regular 		  interval of time.
	
	4)It can get post images, it can post images but inorder to do that you must have processing-java in your computer device. and running 		  the command can get you post the image, provided that the image sketch is made the given folder.
	
		cmd = './processing-java --sketch `pwd`/rainbow --run';
		exe(cmd,processing);
